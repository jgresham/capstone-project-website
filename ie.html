<h1>Information extraction</h1>
<br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most of the world's information is unstructured. Examples of this include
books, encyclopedic websites, forums, and news articles. While humans are able
to understand and extract information from these sources easily, this is a
difficult problem for computers, and not being able to process these documents
hinders the ability for our computational systems and software to use this
unstructured data. Information extraction techniques allow us to extract
structured information from unstructured text so that computational systems
can understand and use it better.</p>
<br />

<h2>Uses in question/answering systems</h2>
<p>Although Watson is able to "understand" unstructured text in a way, many
systems are not able to do so, and in other cases, it's much easier to process
structured text (for example, generating lists, tables, and doing data
analysis).
<br />
An alternative to NLP-heavy systems like Watson is creating a database
(in many cases, a domain-specific database such as one related to medical
topics) and creating an interface with which users can query the system. This
interface can be used with NLP technology to allow users to query it with
natural language, but there is an underlying structured database. An example
of this is Google's Knowledge Graph. KG was developed from
<a href="https://www.freebase.org">Freebase</a>, discussed later in this page. Google
allows you to perform a query such as, "How tall is Obama?", and their NLP
technology plus KG will be able to give the user an answer in natural
language.</p>
<br />

<h2>Named entity recognition</h2>
<p>Named entity recognition is used to identify which tokens in text could
be grounded as entities which are part of world knowledge (for example,
country names, dates, and peoples' names). These can be used not only to
create the basis for a database (one entry per entity), but also for easier
processing of unstructured text. Once a system is relatively sure of which
tokens indicate named entities, it can more easily process the relations
between the entities.</p>
